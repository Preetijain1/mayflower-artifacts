SVG icons were generated from Avocode with the following manual modifications

1. The fill and stroke styling were removed from the path elements
2. A viewbox attribute was added to the SVG element that matched the width and height of the SVG

Example:
<svg id="SvgjsSvg1029" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" version="1.1" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:svgjs="http://svgjs.com/svgjs" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16">
